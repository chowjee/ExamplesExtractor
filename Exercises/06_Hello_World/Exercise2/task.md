## Hello, World! (#2)

Print the same phrase "Hello, Kotlin!" to the console, but "Kotlin" should appear on the next line.
You can print two separate strings to achieve that:

```
Hello,
Kotlin!
```

Try replacing `println` with `print` and see what changes.

Note that tests for all the following tasks assume that you use `println`, not `print`, 
as a default way to print out the data to the console.
