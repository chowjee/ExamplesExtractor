## Hello World (#2)

Print the same phrase "Hello, Kotlin!" to the output, but "Kotlin" should go in the next line.
You can print two separate strings to achieve that: 

```
Hello,
Kotlin!
```

Try to replace `println` with `print` and see what changes.

<!--- Edu. To speed up the typing of the `main` function type just `main` and press `TAB`. --->
