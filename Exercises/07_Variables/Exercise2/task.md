## Variables (#2)

Declare two `var`s `x` and `y`.
Swap their contents (you can first try saying `x = y`, `y = x` and then fix the erroneous solution):
```
var x = 1
var y = 2
// swap
println(x) // 2
println(y) // 1
```

Your code should remain unchanged for different initializers, like
`var x = "first"`, `var y = "second"`.
Thus saying just `x = 2`, `y = 1` is not the expected solution.
Tip: you may need to introduce a third auxiliary variable.
