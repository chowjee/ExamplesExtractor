## Number Types (#1)

Make sure you understand how arithmetical operations work.
Write down your answers to the following expressions and then check yourself using Kotlin:

```kotlin
val a = 11 / 3
val b = 11 % 3
val c = a * 3 + b

val d = 6 / 5.0
```

Note that the variables `a`, `b` and `c` have `Int` type, while the variable `d` has `Double` type.
