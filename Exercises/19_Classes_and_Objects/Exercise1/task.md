Palindromes are words or phrases that read the same forward
and backward. Some examples include "mom" and "dad." Write a method
to test words or phrases for palindromes. Hint: `String`'s
`reversed` member function may prove useful here.

Some examples: 
"mom" is a palindrome
"dad" is a palindrome
"street" is not a palindrome

HINT: A string is a palindrome if it equals to its reversed version.
Use `==` to check whether two strings are equal.
