## Classes & Objects (#3)

Building on the previous exercise, strip out special characters
before palindrome testing. 
"Madam I'm adam" should be considered as a palindrome.

HINT: Build an extra string consisting of letters only, and check whether it's
a palindrome.
Use `in` to check if a character is an alphabetical letter:
`ch in 'a'..'z' || c in 'A'..'Z'`.
